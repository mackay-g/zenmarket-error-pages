# zenmarket-error-pages

Description: About a year ago (before I started) a task was started to create a more beautiful 404 page using illustrations of Luna and interesting text, all the text and languages were translated, but nothing done from the IT side.

Asana Task: https://app.asana.com/0/1149691123357268/1149691123357363/f
Translations: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15awHksjhbjPNpwqQI9fRRAhaQZPpiEVoIHL2QMvUWYE/edit?usp=sharing

Goal: Creat a multilanguage 404 page Randomizer with a different message and picture on reload

Features:
- Different design comes up randomly (picture and text match)
- Countdown timer before redirect to ZenMarket.jp
- 14 languages (Correct language shows via (maybe) browser detection (or IT can serve different languages based on url)
- Randomizer button while counting down? (optional)
- Pull from Json files
- Vanilla Javascript/Jquery

Questions:
- What is the best way to stucture the data?
- What is best way to handle different languages (Navigator.language? Browser languge? Website url e.g /en /ja)
- How can I deal with different layouts? (some designs swap picture to left or right)

Please download and use locally with a server for GetJSON to work.
